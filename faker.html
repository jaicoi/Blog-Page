                Gear 5 is a ridiculous-yet-formidable transformation spurred into being by the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, the legendary Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows its ingester to stretch to epic proportions, effectively turning them into a “rubber human” of sorts. Having already unlocked the powers of Gears 2, 3, and 4, Luffy realizes this latest Gear 5 ability during his final battle with antagonist Kaidou of the Beasts on Onigashima, which takes place in Chapter 1,044 of the One Piece manga.
